// Facebook logic
// The native facebook application transitions back to an authenticating application when the user
// chooses to either log in, or cancel. The url passed to this method contains the token in the
// case of a successful login. By passing the url to the handleOpenURL method of a session object
// the session object can parse the URL, and capture the token for use by the rest of the authenticating
// application; the return value of handleOpenURL indicates whether or not the URL was handled by the
// session object, and does not reflect whether or not the login was successful; the session object's
// state, as well as its arguments passed to the state completion handler indicate whether the login
// was successful; note that if the session is nil or closed when handleOpenURL is called, the expression
// will be boolean NO, meaning the URL was not handled by the authenticating application

// Facebook logic
// Whether it is in applicationWillTerminate, in applicationDidEnterBackground, or in some other part
// of your application, it is important that you close an active session when it is no longer useful
// to your application; if a session is not properly closed, a retain cycle may occur between the block
// and an object that holds a reference to the session object; close releases the handler, breaking any
// inadvertant retain cycles
- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    // FBSample logic
    // if the app is going away, we close the session if it is open
    // this is a good idea because things may be hanging off the session, that need
    // releasing (completion block, etc.) and other components in the app may be awaiting
    // close notification in order to do cleanup
